  # Slide in on Scroll Project
  
  The aim of this project is using the scroll event to detect when a nav should be fixed.We handle the scroll events on the **window** object to handle the scroll of the whole      webpage.
  
  For a page, the **scrollX** and **scrollY** properties return the number of pixels that the document is currently scrolled horizontally and vertically.
