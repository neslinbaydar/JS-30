# Countdown Timer Project

The aim of this project is when we click a button or write a minute,it is ```making a countdown timer```.

ðŸŽ¯There are also two important points for this project which are ```setInterval``` and ```clearInterval```.

ðŸŽ¯With these two,we counted down the time given, unless it is zero.And then,using **clearInterval** we stop the interval when finished.

**Here is a photo of how it looks :**
