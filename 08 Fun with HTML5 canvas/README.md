# Fun with HTML5 canvas

The aim of this project is working on **HTML canvas references** such as **strokeStyle() property,property of line styles such as lineCap,lineJoin and lineWidth**.Also I used methods of html canvas such as **stroke(),beginPath(),closePath(),moveTo().**

If you wonder how to make a **rainbow-like color** in this project, check this website **https://mothereffinghsl.com/**.
