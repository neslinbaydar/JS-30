# JS References VS Copy Project

The aim of this project is working on an array reference vs array copy.In order to do that,we used slice and concat array methods.We also used ES6 **spread operator** and we have made a copy of array by using **Object.assign()**.

**Demo [here](https://neslinbaydar.github.io/JS-30/14%20JavaScript%20References%20VS%20Copying/index.html)**
